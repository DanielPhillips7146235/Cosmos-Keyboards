## VIK Modules

Since this microcontroller supports VIK, you can use any [VIK module](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/vik?tab=readme-ov-file#modules) with it. The list of VIK-enabled keyboards is growing as well, so if you decide you don't like your Cosmos board you can easily re-use these modules on another keyboard.

Some modules I recommend are:

- [PMW3360](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/vik/tree/master/pcb/pmw3360/). Great electrically, but I'm a little worried the physical size might be too large for most Cosmos boards. Needs testing. Only applicable to the Wired Lemon; PMW3610 is more power efficient for Wireless.
- [Joysticks](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/vik/tree/master/pcb/joysticks/). A neat little PCB for connecting [Adafruit 2765](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2765), [SparkFun 9032](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9032), or [Nintendo Joycon](https://www.amazon.com/Replacement-Joystick-Nintendo-Original-Professional/dp/B08397JQZG/) joysticks.
- [Procyon](https://github.com/george-norton/procyon) and [Peacock](https://github.com/george-norton/peacock). Awesome open-source trackpads.
- Cirque Glidepoint trackpads. You cannot use these with the Lemon microcontrollers using a standard FPC cable. However, they will work with the Cactus connect cable I make, because it avoids routing the RGB output to conflict with the trackpad's button outputs.
