# [Coming Soon] Assembly Service

3D-Printing, Wiring, and Programming your own keyboard is an extremely fulfilling experience, and I hope everyone gets to try it sometime! Nevertheless, it's not for everyone. Most first-timers spend multiple weekends learning the required skills and assembling their keyboard, and the first prototype never goes as planned. If you can't afford that time or want a higher-quality keyboard, you might be interested in letting someone experienced manufacture your keyboard for you.

**What it is**: You'll be able to order a pre-assembled, pre-programmed keyboard directly from Cosmos. You do the designing, Cosmos will guide you through ensuring the keyboard is manufacturable, and one of our partners will do the rest.

**What it's not**: This won't be replacing any current functionality in Cosmos. We love making and [open source](https://github.com/rianadon/Cosmos-Keyboards), and DIY builds will still be the heart of the generator.

**Who it is**: Over the year and a half of running this generator, I've met a few enterprising users of the site from around the globe who love and sell custom keyboards. I'll be partnering with them and sharing our keyboard knowledge to give you expert-produced custom keyboards.

**When it is**: There's still a lot of work to be done on everyone's end. Expect this to go live in 2 months.
