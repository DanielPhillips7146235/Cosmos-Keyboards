# Mechanical

Cosmos supports three different types of mechanical switches:

- **MX**: Most common, thocky switches.
- **Choc**: Low-profile switches (closer to those on laptops)
- **Alps**: Much more rare, but they are usually highly rated

Furthermore, Choc comes in two varieties: Choc V1 and Choc V2. Whereas Choc V1 is designed to fit special Choc keycaps, Choc V2 works with MX keycaps. If you're building a low-profile keyboard I recommend Choc V1, as Choc keycaps are thinner than MX keycaps.

## How They Work

In lieu of writing an essay here, I'll link you to two very good resources:

- ThereminGoat's [A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Switches](https://www.theremingoat.com/blog/beginners-guide)
- The Keyboard Company's [An introduction to Cherry MX mechanical switches](https://www.thekeyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/an-introduction-to-cherry-mx-mechanical-switches/)

## How to Pick One

There's a few important qualities to choose in switches:

- Volume (some switches are silent, others make loud clicky noises)
- Linear vs Tactile (is there a "bump" when pressing down the key?)
- Actuation Force (how hard it is to press the switch)

You may change your mind after trying a few switches, so don't be too picky at the beginning. It helps to try a few switches before spending lots of money on a set.

If you have a friend with a mechanical keyboard or a local keyboard shop, you should try their switches! You can also buy "switch testers" online, which are plates with one of every kind of switch on it.
