# Lemon Wireless

The Lemon Wireless is an nRF52840-based microcontroller for split keyboards with a USB-C port, power switch, JST battery connector, a VIK connector, and two FPC connectors for connecting column-flex PCBs. If you use column-flex PCBs and VIK-compatible peripherals, it's possible to build a wireless split keyboard without soldering any wires!

If you haven't already, I suggest you check out the [Lemon Landing page](https://ryanis.cool/lemon) to learn more.
