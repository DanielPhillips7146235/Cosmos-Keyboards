# Cosmos Keyboards

This is not complete! I'm only releasing the hand measuring stuff as open source for now.
That code is at [`src/routes/scan`](https://github.com/rianadon/Cosmos-Keyboards/tree/main/src/routes/scan). Most of the processing happens in [`lib/hand.ts`](https://github.com/rianadon/Cosmos-Keyboards/tree/main/src/routes/scan/lib/hand.ts).

I'm hoping to have the rest of the source released + general release around mid-August. In the meantime, you can find information on how to beta test the generator on the [project website](https://ryanis.cool/cosmos/).

Please feel free to use either GitHub or Discord for submitting issues.

### Hand Scanning
I'm planning on building out an API to make it easy for users to share their scanned hand data with other keyboard-related websites. If you maintain a keyboard-related site and are interested in adding a way for visitors to quickly see how your keyboard fits their hand, send me an email at ryan `@` ryanis.cool. You can of course use this code to build out your own hand scanning solution, provided you abide by the terms of the [AGPL-3.0 license](https://github.com/rianadon/Cosmos-Keyboards/blob/main/LICENSE).
