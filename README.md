# Cosmos Keyboards

This is not complete! I'm only releasing the hand measuring stuff as open source for now.
That code is at [`src/routes/scan`](https://github.com/rianadon/Cosmos-Keyboards/tree/main/src/routes/scan). Most of the processing happens in [`lib/hand.ts`](https://github.com/rianadon/Cosmos-Keyboards/tree/main/src/routes/scan/lib/hand.ts).

I'm hoping to have the rest of the source released + general release around mid-August. In the meantime, you can find information on how to beta test the generator on the [project website](https://ryanis.cool/cosmos/).

Please feel free to use either GitHub or Discord for submitting issues.
